# Usage

Once the application is up, visit the public URL of the instance to start using it.

## Admin setup

The application is pre-configured with one admin user with username `admin` and password `hunter2`.

After logging in, you'll be prompted to update your password with a stronger password.

## Add projects

After logging in and changing password, you'll be brought to the home page. Click on the `Settings` button at the top to go to the settings page. You can start by adding your first project.

Start by giving the project a name (Web, MobileWeb, InternalCRM etc). The timezone field is for the timezone that you'd want the metrics to be reported in.

## Project setup

Once the project is added, click on `Setup Instructions` to get the tracking snippet. Enter the public URL of the instance in the base URL field and click on `Copy to clipboard`.

Add this tracking snippet to all your webpages that you want to be tracked.

## Add users

In the settings page, click on the `Users` tab to add more users. An user can be an Admin or a normal User.

Admins can create/edit/delete projects and other users. Normal Users cannot do this.

Once a new user is created, they can login using their username and the default password `hunter2`. They'll be prompted to update their password after login.
